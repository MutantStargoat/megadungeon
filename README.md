Dungeon view data
-----------------
3D dungeon view window is 320x152.

Pre-rendered 3D dungeon views are generated by running `vrlugburz`
(https://github.com/MutantStargoat/vrlugburz) with the following settings in
`game.cfg`:

    size = 1280x608
    scr = prerender
    vsync = false
    vr = false

This creates a 4x super-sampled set of images, which are then downsampled and
placed into an atlas for color quantization, dithering, tile splitting,
deduplication and mapping, by `tools/viewproc` (work in progress).
